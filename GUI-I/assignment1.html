    Created: September 3rd, 2015.
    Last Updated: September 15th, at 9PM.

    Note: this file is somewhat a copy of index.html, with the body changed to reflect what I did for assignment 1.
    I did this to keep the same look and Nav bar as my index.html file, but still be able to change text  and add stuff.
    I left all the comments in tact as well for future reference.

    <!-- I found this on Stackoverflow. I'm using this trick to make the "About" link actually go all the way to the top of the

            I completed the following tasks:

            <!-- Ordered list of what I did.
                Highlighting didn't show up for some reason, so I added it here as well.
                w3schools yet again was really helpful for figuring this out.
                I used both of the following sites for help:
                http://www.w3schools.com/tags/tag_ol.asp
                http://www.w3schools.com/tags/tag_ul.asp -->
            <ol class="highlight">
              <li> Complete Course Registration

                <!-- It made sense to explain what exactly I did and didn't do with bullets, since
                    technically this assignment is optional. Also, why not mess around with them?
                    And I added random helpful links in case people check out this page.

                    Also, side note, I had to include the <ul> tags inside of the <li> tag for the <ol>.
                    Otherwise, w3 validator complained.
                    Stackoverflow was once again helpful with explaining this:

                  <li>First I completed the registration Google form</li>
                  <li>Then I joined the
                  <a href="https://piazza.com/">Piazza</a>
                  forum and checked it out over the next few days.</li>
                  <li>Finally I did the pre-course survey.</li>
                </ul>
              </li>
              <li> Get a web server up and running

                  I just ran "sudo apt-get install apache2" on my Linux machine </li>
                  <li> Then I spent a while configuring Apache.
                      I made a public_html folder and got stuff to display on local host. </li>
                  <li> Then I saw a link on Piazza about Python's simple server. And it was way easier to use. </li>

                  <!-- Linking to an awesome resource on how to use Python's simple HTTP server. -->
                  <li> So now I just run

                  <li> I personally dislike IDEs. </li>
                  <li> Since they aren't required for this class, I just didn't install any. </li>
                  <li> I typically use either

                  <li> After I configured

                  <a href = "https://www.sublimetext.com/3">Sublime 3</a>
                   though I began to really like it. So I now use that for the most part. </li>
