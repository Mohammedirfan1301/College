    This JavaScript file contains a function called sendEmail which whenever the user clicks on the "Submit" button
    it gets called. It will email me their message assuming they entered a name / valid email address.

    This function is based off of an earlier piece of JS I wrote for a friend's website. I simplified it since I didn't use
    a form on this website. You can find the code for that JavaScript file here:

  var email_name, email_address, email_message;
