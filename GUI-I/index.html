  Note: much of this design comes from a previous personal website that I
  built over the summer. I've redesigned this one, using much of the same
  <head> but redoing nearly all of the body. Some of the CSS is similar or reused,
  but most of it was changed. I also added multiple pages and the navigation
  bar at the top. The navigation bar has a dropdown menu titled "Index"
  that will contain links to future projects and assignments.
