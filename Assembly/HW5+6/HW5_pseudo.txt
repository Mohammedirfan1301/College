Pseudo Code

# This is just a pseudo code example for Comp Org.
# Actual program will be written in MIPS.

symStatus:

			# 	The following numbers mean: 
			# (First time the token has appeared, already defined, DEFN)

			if 0 0 0
				# Forward Reference.
				Store LOC in the token value field (TVF) of NODE.
				Return previous contents of the TVF.

			if 0 0 1
				# Previously used token has been defined for the 1st time.
				Store LOC in the TVF of NODE.
				Return the previous contents of TVF.


			if 0 1 0
				# Previously defined TOKEN is used.
				return TVF

			if 0 1 1
				# Previously defined TOKEN is defined again.
				print "Double Definition Error"
				return -1 # FFFFx

			if 1 0 0
				# TOKEN seen for first time, as forward reference.
				store LOC in TVF of NODE
				return -1 # FFFFx

			if 1 0 1
				# TOKEN seen for first time as definition
				store LOC in TVF of NODE
				mark TOKEN as defined.

			if 1 1 0
				Do nothing.

			if 1 1 1
