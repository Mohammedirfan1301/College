#GUI-II
GUI-II course taken at UMass Lowell.

This course was a project orientated course, and I used it as the second required project sequence.

The project for this course can be found in the base of this College repository.

But you can also find the project hosted at the following URL: [downing.io/Ski-Maps](http://downing.io/Ski-Maps/)
