All of the test files are actual genetic data (save the spell comparisons)
taken from GenBank. Files fli*.txt come from bacterial flagellar protiens,
ftsa.txt is a cell division protien. stx*.txt contain the gene for the
toxin in the "Jack-in-the-box" E. Coli that caused illness and death in the
Western US in 1993 after it contaminated a batch of hamburger meat.  The
genetic data comes from the E. Coli as well as the origin of the toxin,
the Shagella bacteria.  The ecoli*.txt files are the first set number of
base pairs from two types of E. Coli: the labratory strain, E. Coli K12, and
the "Jack-in-the-Box" E. Coli, E. Coli O157:H7.

List of Files
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
Name: fli8.txt
Length: 10 and 8 bp
Protein: FliC (flagellar Cap protein)
Species: E. Coli K12 & Salmonella typhi
Notes: This file should test for insertion of gaps along with mismatches

Name: fli9.txt
Length: 9 and 7 bp
Protein: FliC (flagellar cap protein)
Species: E. Coli K12 & Salmonella typhi
Notes: This file test for consecutive gaps; very easy to recognize best 
match

Name: fli10.txt
Length: 10 and 10 bp
Protein: FliC (flagellar cap protein)
Species: E. Coli K12 & Salmonella typhi
Notes: This file tests for no gap only mismatches; easy to recognize best 
match

Name: stx19.txt
Length: 19 and 19 bp
Protein: StxA and StxB (Shiga Toxin Subunits A&B)
Species: Shigella Dysenteriae & E.Coli 0157:H7 (Jack-in-the-Box E. Coli)
Notes: This file test for gaps on each side

Length: 21 and 26 bp
Protein: StxA and StxB (Shiga Toxin Subunits A&B)
Species: Shigella Dysenteriae & E.Coli 0157:H7
Notes: Just a longer string that has gaps, consecutive gaps, and mismatches

Name: stx27.txt
Length: 21 and 27 bp
Protein: StxA and StxB (Shiga Toxin Subunits A&B)
Species: Shigella Dysenteriae & E.Coli 0157:H7
Notes: Longer string w/ consecutive gaps

Name: gene57.txt
Length: 57 and 56 bp
Protein: ?
Species: ?
Notes: Sequence Contained in assignment writeup

Name: ftsa.txt
Length: 1263 and 1272 bp
Protein: FtsA (A cell division protein)
Species: E. Coli K12 and Cresentus Caulobacter
Notes:

Name: stx1230.txt
Length: 1213 and 1230
Protein: StxA and StxB (Shiga Toxin Subunits A&B)
Species: Shigella Dysenteriae & E.Coli 0157:H7
Notes: This is the gene in the "Jack-in-the-Box" E. Coli epidemic in the 
Western US in 1993, as found in both the E.Coli itself and the original 
host for the virulence genes

Name: ecoli5000.txt
Length: 5000 and 5000 bp
Proteins: First 5000 bp of genome
Species: E. Coli K12 & E.Coli O157:H7
Notes: The entire genomes of both bacteria are on the university of 
Wisconson website in text formats. Each is 4.4 mbp long.
