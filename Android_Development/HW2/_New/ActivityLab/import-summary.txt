ECLIPSE ANDROID PROJECT IMPORT SUMMARY
======================================

 * Project
   ActivityLabTest:/home/jason/Github/School/College/AndroidDev/HW2/Tests/Activi
   yLabTest/.classpath:
   Could not resolve source path /ActivityLab in project ActivityLabTest:
   ignored. The project may not compile if the given source path provided source
   code.


Replaced Jars with Dependencies:
--------------------------------
The importer recognized the following .jar files as third party
libraries and replaced them with Gradle dependencies instead. This has
the advantage that more explicit version information is known, and the
libraries can be updated automatically. However, it is possible that
the .jar file in your project was of an older version than the
dependency we picked, which could render the project not compileable.
You can disable the jar replacement in the import wizard and try again:

robotium-solo-5.0.1.jar => com.jayway.android.robotium:robotium-solo:5.0.1

Potentially Missing Dependency:
-------------------------------
When we replaced the following .jar files with a Gradle dependency, we
inferred the dependency version number from the filename. This
specific version may not actually be available from the repository.
If you get a build error stating that the dependency is missing, edit
the version number to for example "+" to pick up the latest version
instead. (This may require you to update your code if the library APIs
have changed.)

robotium-solo-5.0.1.jar => version 5.0.1 in com.jayway.android.robotium:robotium-solo:5.0.1

Moved Files:
------------
Android Gradle projects use a different directory structure than ADT
Eclipse projects. Here's how the projects were restructured:

* AndroidManifest.xml => activityLabTest/src/main/AndroidManifest.xml
* res/ => activityLabTest/src/main/res/
* src/ => activityLabTest/src/main/java/

Next Steps:
-----------
You can now build the project. The Gradle project needs network
connectivity to download dependencies.

Bugs:
-----
If for some reason your project does not build, and you determine that
it is due to a bug or limitation of the Eclipse to Gradle importer,
please file a bug at http://b.android.com with category
Component-Tools.
