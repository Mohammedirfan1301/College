Degree of success: 95%

This assignment was pretty straight forward. I began by going to Prof. Moloney's site,
and viewing the help file for this assignment at the following URL: http://www.cs.uml.edu/~bill/cs305/Assignment_7_help.txt
I copied this file and began modifying it. I really only had to add in the sprintf line,
and fill in the switch statement as well. The switch statement code is pretty similar
to the previous code in the file which made it easy to figure out and implement fully.
My program runs and outputs almost the exact same code that Prof. Moloney asks for in
the help file. The one minor issue with my version is that one line appears in the wrong
spot. I noted this in the output file, but to be clear it is the line that says
"PARENT PROG: Created child with 8386 PID". It should appear after the line that
says "about to read pipe and report parent message:" but instead it appears right
after the parent proc finishes. Other than that issue, my programs output matches
perfectly. As a result, I feel like I was 95% successful, since the output is
almost the same minus that one issue I mentioned previously.
