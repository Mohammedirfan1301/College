********************************************************************************
	This is the output file for assignment 7. It is pretty straight forward,
	as it follows almost the exact output that the help file lays out at:
	http://www.cs.uml.edu/~bill/cs305/Assignment_7_help.txt
********************************************************************************

This is the Parent process report:

PARENT PROG:  Process ID is:		8385

PARENT PROC:  Real GID is:		1000
PARENT PROC:  Effective UID is:		1000
PARENT PROC:  Effective GID is:		1000
PARENT PROC:  Process priority is:	0

PARENT PROC: will now create child, write pipe,
   and do a normal termination

********************************************************************************
	This line is in the wrong spot! It should be below the child process
	report, after the "about to read pipe and report parent message:" line.
********************************************************************************
