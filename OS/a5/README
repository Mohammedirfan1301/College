For this homework assignment, I was able to implement the allocation requests
and memory free operations for the best fit and first fit linked lists. I was
not able to finish the buddy system implementation as I ran out of time before
the submission deadline. As a result, I estimate that I am 70% successful in
completing this homework assignment.

I have created a Makefile which will compile my program.
If you would like to compile the code, type make all in the terminal.
For testing the code, type make files and that will generate the four
(out of six) files for the code that I have completed (best / first fit).
You can clean the directory using make clean, and all object files / output
files will be deleted.

The following is from my Makefile and will generate the files requested:
  ./a5 first 512 proj5_data > output_first_512kb.txt
  ./a5 first 1024 proj5_data > output_first_1024kb.txt
  ./a5 best 512 proj5_data > output_best_512kb.txt
  ./a5 best 1024 proj5_data > output_best_1024kb.txt

Final summary below:

Best  fit  512KB:
Best  fit 1024KB:
First fit  512KB:
First fit 1024KB:

I used the header file provided by Prof. Moloney found at this URL:
http://www.cs.uml.edu/~bill/cs308/Assignment_5_data_structs.txt
I heavily modified it however.

Also, I used the proj5_data file found at this URL to test my code:
