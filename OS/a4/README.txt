I believe I was 100% successful in writing the code, as the majority of it was
provided by Professor Moloney on his cs308 website:
http://www.cs.uml.edu/~bill/cs308/

As a result, I spent most of my time trying to figure out how to run to generate
graphs for the required test cases. The Makefile I have provided has everything
need to run and clean the project. The shell script included is setup to default
to 5 consumers but I left commented out code for running from 1 to 10 consumers.

I have also attached an excel file and graphs in PDF format.

For graph 1...

For graph 2...
