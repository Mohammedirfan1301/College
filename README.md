UML Course Work
==================

This repository includes the following:

* Computing I using C (Intro course)

* Computing II using C (Data Structures)

* Computing III using C++ (OOP)

* Computing IV using C++, along with various APIs such as Boost and SFML (OOP). This was for [COMP 2040](http://www.cs.uml.edu/ecg/index.php/Comp4spr15/Comp4spr15).

* Computer Organization and Assembly Language Programming using MIPS and some IA32

* Logic Design - Logic Works circuit diagrams. I don't even know why this class was required, considering Comp Org/Assembly basically went over everything Logic Design went over, minus fun kmaps. Either way the class was for [EECE 2650](http://faculty.uml.edu/Tricia_Chigan/Courses/16_265/LogicDesign.html)

* Android Development - various apps for an Android Dev class, including a final project which can be found in the [UML-Alerts repository](https://github.com/JasonD94/UML-Alerts). There's no website for this class for whatever reason so just check out the Android stuff! This course was one of my CS electives.

* Computer Architecture - C / MIC1 programs written for [COMP 3050](http://www.cs.uml.edu/~bill/cs305/)

* Operating Systems - C / C++ programs written for [COMP 3080](http://www.cs.uml.edu/~bill/cs308/)

* OPL (Organization of Programming Languages) - racket programs, including a final project which can be found in the [Racket Weather repository](https://github.com/oplS16projects/Racket-Weather). This fun bitch of a class was for [COMP 3010](http://www.cs.uml.edu/ecg/index.php/OPLspr16/OPLspr16).

* GUI I can be found in the [GUI repository](https://github.com/JasonD94/GUI). You can find the [Scrabble repo here](https://github.com/JasonD94/scrabble), which was basically the final "project" or assignment for this course. I took this course as the first part of my project sequence for [COMP 4610](https://teaching.cs.uml.edu/~heines/91.461/91.461-2014-15f/461home.jsp)

* GUI II can be found in the [Ski-Maps repository](https://github.com/JasonD94/Ski-Maps). This was the second part of my project sequence course for [COMP 4620](https://teaching.cs.uml.edu/~heines/91.462/91.462-2015-16s/462home.jsp)

* Foundations of Computer Science - finite automata, and all sorts of fun stuff like PDAs, CFGs, CNF form, trees, derivations, and all sorts of fun diagrams that are a bitch to make in [LaTeX!](https://www.latex-project.org/) All of this fun stuff for [COMP 3040](http://www.cs.uml.edu/~kseethar/Fall2016/COMP.3040/) and the low low price of just 50 hours of my life!

* Analysis of Algorithms - to be taken during Spring 2017. Should look like [COMP 4040](http://www.cs.uml.edu/~kdaniels/courses/ALG_404_S15.html) but with [Prof. Lin](https://www.uml.edu/Sciences/computer-science/faculty/Lin-Sirong.aspx).

* Database I - Relational Algebra, basic SQL, and a final project that can be found in the [Database I Project](https://github.com/JasonD94/Database-I-Project) repo. All this fun stuff for [COMP 3090](http://www.cs.uml.edu/~cchen/309-F16/index.html). I used this class as one of my CS electives.

* Database II - SUPER "ADVANCED" TOPICS IN DATABASE SYSTEMS! INCLUDES (ONE) WEB BASED DATABASE WRITTEN IN MYSQL AND PHP! All to be taken during Spring 2017. Should look like [COMP 3100](http://www.cs.uml.edu/~cchen/310-S16/index.html). This class was taken as one of my technical electives.
