* Computing IV using C++, along with various APIs such as Boost and SFML (OOP)

* Computer Organization and Assembly Language Programming using MIPS and some IA32

* Logic Design - Logic Works circuit diagrams

* Android Development - various apps for an Android Dev class, including a final project which can be found in the [UML-Alerts repository](https://github.com/JasonD94/UML-Alerts)

* Computer Architecture - C / MIC1 programs written for [COMP 3050](http://www.cs.uml.edu/~bill/cs305/)

* Operating Systems - C / C++ programs written for [COMP 3080](http://www.cs.uml.edu/~bill/cs308/)

* GUI I can be found in the [GUI repository](https://github.com/JasonD94/GUI)

* GUI II can be found in the [Ski-Maps repository](https://github.com/JasonD94/Ski-Maps)

* Foundations of Computer Science - finite automata, and all sorts of fun stuff like PDAs, CFGs, CNF form, trees, derivations, and all sorts of fun diagrams that are a bitch to make in [LaTeX!](https://www.latex-project.org/) All of this fun stuff for [COMP 3040](http://www.cs.uml.edu/~kseethar/Fall2016/COMP.3040/) and the low low price of just 50 hours of my life!

* Database I - Relational Algebra, basic SQL, and a final project that can be found in the [Database I Project](https://github.com/JasonD94/Database-I-Project) repo. All this fun stuff for [COMP 3090](http://www.cs.uml.edu/~cchen/309-F16/index.html)

* Analysis of Algorithms - to be taken during Spring 2017. Should look like [COMP 4040](http://www.cs.uml.edu/~kdaniels/courses/ALG_404_S15.html) but with [Prof. Lin](https://www.uml.edu/Sciences/computer-science/faculty/Lin-Sirong.aspx).

* Database II - SUPER "ADVANCED" TOPICS IN DATABASE SYSTEMS! INCLUDES (ONE) WEB BASED DATABASE WRITTEN IN MYSQL AND PHP! All to be taken during Spring 2017. Should look like [COMP 3100](http://www.cs.uml.edu/~cchen/310-S16/index.html)
