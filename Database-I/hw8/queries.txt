Product (maker, model, type)
PC (model, speed, ram, hd, price)
Laptop (model, speed, ram, hd, screen, price)
Printer (model, color, type, price)

of Exercise 2.4.1. Modify your SQL scheme from Exercise 2.3.1 to include
declarations of these keys.

ALTER TABLE Product
  ADD PRIMARY KEY (model);

ALTER TABLE PC
  ADD FOREIGN KEY (model) REFERENCES Product (model);

ALTER

7.2.2

Write the following constraints on attributes from our example scheme

Product (maker, model, type)
PC (model, speed, ram, hd, price)
Laptop (model, speed, ram, hd, screen, price)
Printer (model, color, type, price)

of Exercise 2.4.1.

a) The speed of a laptop must be at least 2.0.

b) The only types of printers are laser, ink-jet, and bubble-jet.

c) The only types of products are PC's, laptops and printers.

d) A model of a product must also be the model of a PC, a laptop, or a
printer

7.4.1

Write the following assertions. The database scheme is from the "PC" example
of Exercise 2.4.1:

Product (maker, model, type)
PC (model, speed, ram, hd, price)
Laptop (model, speed, ram, hd, screen, price)
Printer (model, color, type, price)

a) No manufacturer of PC's may also make laptops.

b) A manufacturer of a PC must also make a laptop with at least as great as
processor speed.

c) If a laptop has a larger main memory than a PC, then the laptop must also
have a higher price than the PC.

d) If the relation Product mentions a model and its type, then this model must
appear in the relation appropriate to that type.

7.5.2

Write the following as triggers. In each case, disallow or undo the
modification if it does not satisfy the stated constraint. The database schema
is from the "PC" example of Exercise 2.4.1:

Product (maker, model, type)
PC (model, speed, ram, hd, price)
Laptop (model, speed, ram, hd, screen, price)
Printer (model, color, type, price)

a) When updating the price of a PC, check that there is no lower priced PC
with the same speed.

b) When inserting a new printer, check that the model number exists in Product.

c) When making any modification to the Laptop relation, check that the average
price of laptops for each manufacturer is at least $1500.

d) When updating the RAM or hard disk of any PC, check that the updated PC has
at least 100 times as much hard disk as RAM.

e) When inserting a new PC, laptop, or printer, make sure that the model number
did not previously appear in any of PC, Laptop, or Printer.
