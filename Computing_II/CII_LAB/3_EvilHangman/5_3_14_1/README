	To submit use:
  	
  	submit dlipman hangman \
    generic_vector.c mystring.c dictionary.c assocarray.c \
    mystring.h dictionary.h assocarray.h generic_vector.h status.h \
    dictionaryTest.c assocarrayTest.c \
    hangman.c Makefile README

	Done:
	MYSTRING.C
	MYSTRINGTESTS.C
	DICTIONARY.C
	DICTIONARYTESTS.C
	ASSOCARRAY.C
	ASSOCARRAYTEST.C
	HANGMAN.C (MASSIVE memory leaks! BUT it seems to work!!!)

	Notes:
	Mystring.c 
	- NO MEMORY LEAKS UDER VALGRIND.
	- Passes all 48 of derrell's tests
	- Passes all 18 of my tests
	
	Dictionary.c
	- NO MEMORY LEAKS UNDER VALGRIND.
	- Passes dictionary.c test
	- Has functions to get which ever sized vector of mystring that you want.
	
	Assocarray.c
	- IT WORKS. I think.
	- NO memory leaks running the tester I made
	- It seems to sort the dictionary file, and I can grab the node with the
	  largest generic_vector.
	
	AssocarrayTest.c
	- See above
	
	_Hangman.c 
	- Asks user for basic information about the game
	- Doesn't crash as far as I can tell.
	- Does all required checks, ensuring that nothing that is NULL or invalid is
	  used or passed to other functions. 
	- Ensures user input is valid.
	- Massive memory leaks ATM. Working on fixing stuff
	- Appears to work fine and does, in fact, let you win the game if you have enough
	  guesses!

	KNOWN ISSUES:
	- Warnings about "implicit declaration" of two functions in hangman.c. After I
	  added additional declarations of those functions, they went away. Not sure if
	  that is the right thing to do or not. Functions are found in dictionary.c,
	  perhaps that is why - hangman.c can't see them directly?

	DICTIONARY.C NOTES
	In order to get the vector of mystrings to work, I had to put some functions,
	such as mystring assignment and mystring destroyer, into the mystring.c file.
	gcc dictionary_tests.c dictionary.c generic_vector.c mystring.c -o test
	Also, in a related note, to get the vector a vector part to work I had to do
	the same thing, except I put myvector_assignment and myvector_destroyer in
	the generic_vector.c file. 
	
	Made it less straight forward, but it seems to work!
	
	MAKEFILE:
	Basically I just used Derrell's makefile with a few modifications:
	- Added a make clean command, so I can force a recompile. Helpful with some random
	  bugs that seem to appear and disappear.
	- Added a make all, so it compiles everything at once. You can simply type
	  make <option>
	  to make one of the options, ie only assocarrayTest or only Hangman, etc.
