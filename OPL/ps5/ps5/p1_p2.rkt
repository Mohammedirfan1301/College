;;; Problem 1: Exercise 2.76
   
;;;Answer: 

;;;    For each of the three strategies -- generic operations with
;;;    explicit dispatch, data-directed style, and
;;;    message-passing-style; describe the changes that must be made
;;;    to a system in order to add new types or new operations.
;;;    Change #f to #t after answering.
(define p1_1 #f)

;;;    Which organization would be most appropriate for a system in
;;;    which new types must often be added?  Change #f to #t after
;;;    answering.
(define p1_2 #f)


;;;    Which would be most appropriate for a system in which new
;;;    operations must often be added?  Change #f to #t after
;;;    answering.
(define p1_3 #f)

;;; Problem 2: Exercise 2.77 

;;;    Describe in detail why this works. As an example, trace through
;;;    all the procedures called in evaluating the expression
;;;    (magnitude z) where z is the object shown in figure 2.24.
;;;    Change #f to #t after answering.
(define p2_1 #f)


;;;    In particular, how many times is apply-generic invoked? 
;;;    What procedure is dispatched to in each case?
;;;    Change #f to #t after answering.
(define p2_2 #f)
