;; 2. Consider the following procedure for operating on trees:
(define (tree-manip tree init leaf accum) 
  (cond ((null? tree) init) 
        ((not (pair? tree)) (leaf tree)) 
        (else (accum  
               (tree-manip (car tree) init leaf accum) 
               (tree-manip (cdr tree) init leaf accum)))))

;; Suppose that we provide a test tree, 
(define test-tree '(1 (2 (3 (4) 5) 6) 7))
;;
;; 2a. Write the parameters to tree-manip that will count the number
;;     of leaves in the tree, evaluating to 7 for test-tree; e.g.:
;;     (tree-manip test-tree <param1> <param2> <param3>). (Figure out
;;     the three parameters.)
;;
;; 2b. Write the parameters to tree-manip that will add the values of
;;     the leaves in the tree, evaluating to 28 for test-tree.
;;
;; 2c. Write the parameters to tree-manip that will triple each of the
;;     values in test-tree, evaluating to (3 (6 (9 (12) 15) 18) 21).

;; Answer:
;2a.
(define (count-leaves tree) 
  ;; give it the tree, starting value of 0,
  ;; (lambda (x) 1) will return 1 for each leaf,
  ;; and + to add all the leaves together.
  ;; Example output: (count-leaves test-tree) => 7
  (tree-manip tree 0 (lambda (x) 1) +)
)

;2b.
(define (sum-leaves tree) 
  ;; give it the tree, starting value of 0,
  ;; (lambda (x) x) will return the value of each leaf,
  ;; and + to add all the values together (sum it up).
  ;; Example output: (sum-leaves test-tree) => 28
  (tree-manip tree 0 (lambda (x) x) +)
)

;2c.
(define (triple-leaves tree) 
  ;; give it the tree, starting value of nil ('()),
  ;; (lambda (x) (* x 3)) will return (x*3) for each leaf,
  ;; and cons will add them all together in a list.
  ;; Example output: (sum-leaves test-tree) => '(3 (6 (9 (12) 15) 18) 21)
  (tree-manip tree nil (lambda (x) (* x 3)) cons)

;op property:
;--------------
#|

The output for (fold-right / 1 (list 1 2 3)) is [3/2], while 
the output for (fold-left / 1 (list 1 2 3)) is [1/6].

The output for (fold-right + 1 (list 1 2 3)) is [7], while
the output for (fold-left + 1 (list 1 2 3)) is also [7].

The output for (fold-right * 1 (list 1 2 3)) is [6], while
the output for (fold-left * 1 (list 1 2 3)) is also [6].

The output for (fold-right - 1 (list 1 2 3)) is [1], while
the output for (fold-left - 1 (list 1 2 3)) is [-5].

Since addition and multiplication show the same results, but
subtraction and division show different results, this means that
fold-right and fold-left will produce the same values for sequences
given that op is both assocative and communitive, which both addition
and multiplication are. Divison and subtraction are not assocative or
communitive which is why they give different results for the same input.

;; 6. Use fold-right to define the function bucket. 
;;
;; It consumes a list of numbers, and returns a list of sublists of
;; adjacent equal numbers.
;;
;; For example:
;; (bucket '(1 1 2 2 2 3 1 1 1 2 3 3)) â€“> 
;;  '((1 1) (2 2 2) (3) (1 1 1) (2) (3 3))
;;
;; PLEASE NOTE
;; it's trivial to find the answer for this on the internet
;; please do not succumb
;; you won't learn very much unless you struggle with it
;;
;; think about each of the two objects that are consumed by the 
;; folding function as the fold proceeds
;;
;; and think about what sort of object should be produced by that
;; function 
;; 
;; for full credit on this, show your work,
;; including partial / broken solutions and explanations
