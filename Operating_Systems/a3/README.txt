Assignment 2 - Grep and Sort

I believe I was 100% successful because both my sort and grep programs compile,
and run with the data files that Prof. Moloney provided. The sort program
displays each area code, sorted in the correct order, and with the number of
unique phone numbers with that area code. The grep program displays how many
matches it found for lines with the number "123" in the line.

I verified the outputs for the grep data sets with the following commands:
asus@asus: a2$ grep -o "123" cs308a2_grep_data_1 | uniq -c
     28 123
asus@asus: a2$ grep -o "123" cs308a2_grep_data_2 | uniq -c
   9158 123

This is interesting because my program appears to infinite loop on the second
dataset. Yet, grep shows 9,158 matches! I believe something with the forking
of the process causes the loop to run endlessly. Grep clearly has some code
built in to handle large datasets, but my program does not take into account
that datasets could be massive (250,000 lines in the grep_data_2).

I verified the output for the sort program by running the following command:
asus@asus: a2$ cut -d' ' -f5 cs308a2_sort_data | sort -n | uniq -c

I found this command at this StackOverFlow post:
http://superuser.com/questions/521891/counting-occurrences-in-first-column-of-a-file

I modified the command to check the 5th field, which is the area code, sort the
data by area code and count the number of lines with each area code. This leads
to the count being outputted first, and then the area code. When I run this
command I get the exact same values as my sort program.

I have provided a Makefile to compile my programs. You can also run my programs
with the following commands:

./a2_sort cs308a2_sort_data
./a2_grep cs308a2_grep_data_1
./a2_grep cs308a2_grep_data_2

I have provided example output in the "output.txt" file. The output in this file
matches the terminal commands that I ran listed above, which is why I feel
confident that my programs are successful.
