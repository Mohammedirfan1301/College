	Matrix Z - Matrix with all 0's, output this to the screen.
	Matrix E - diagonal matrix with 1 on the main diagonal, 0's everywhere else. Output E.
	Matrix D - diagonal matrix with 2 on the main diagonal, 0's everywhere else. Output D.
	Matrix A - elements inputted from a file, output A.
	Matrix B - a copy of A. Check that B == A using the == operator.

	Compute and output the following to the screen:
	A + D
	A - D
	A * D

	Check with == that
	A-B == Z
	-A == Z-A
	A+B == A*D
	A*E = A
	A*D = 2*A

	Compute the determinants of E and D (should = 1 and 8?)

	Create C with the elements inputted from file (uh, what? Again? Ok...)

	check the following property of the determinant: 
	(A*C).det() == A.det()*C.det()

	THEN YOU ARE DONE AND CAN SUBMIT THIS STUFF.
