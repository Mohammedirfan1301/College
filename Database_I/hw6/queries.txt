Chapter 6:
Exercises: 6.3.1 (a, b, c, d), 6.4.6 (b, c, e, h)

Product (maker, model, type)
PC (model, speed, ram, hd, price)
Laptop (model, speed, ram, hd, screen, price)
Printer (model, color, type, price)

6.3.1 (a, b, c, d)
a)

- Find the makers of PC's with a speed of at least 3.0

SELECT DISTINCT maker
FROM Product CROSS JOIN PC
WHERE Product.model = PC.model AND PC.speed > 3.0

Example output from SQLLite Query:
maker
B
E

b)

- Find the printers with the highest price

SELECT model, MAX(price)
FROM printer

Example output:
 model  | Price
"3003"    "899"

c)

- Find the laptops whose speed is slower than that of any PC.

SELECT DISTINCT Laptop.model
FROM Laptop CROSS JOIN PC
WHERE Laptop.speed < PC.speed

d)

- Find the model number of the item (PC, laptop, or printer) with the highest
price.

SELECT DISTINCT model, MAX(price)
FROM PC CROSS JOIN Laptop CROSS JOIN Printer
WHERE price = highest

SELECT *
FROM Laptop a JOIN PC b ON a.model = b.model JOIN Printer c ON a.model = c.model
WHERE


6.4.6 (b, c, e, h)S

Same database schema as 6.3.1

b)

- Find the average speed of laptops costing over $1,000

SELECT AVG(speed)
FROM Laptop
WHERE price > 1000

Example Output:
AVG(speed)
1.99833333333333

c)

- Find the average price of PC's made by manufacturer "A".

SELECT AVG(price)
FROM Product JOIN PC
WHERE maker = "A"

Example Output:
AVG(price)
827.076923076923

e)

- Find, for each different speed, the average price of a PC.

SELECT DISTINCT speed, AVG(price)
FROM PC
GROUP BY speed

Example output:
Speed   |   AVG(price)
"1.42"      "478.0"
"1.86"      "959.0"
"2.0"       "650.0"
"2.1"       "995.0"
"2.2"       "640.0"
"2.66"      "2114.0"
"2.8"       "689.333333333333"
"3.06"      "529.0"
"3.2"       "839.5"

h)

- Find for each manufacturer who sells PC's, the maximum price of a PC.

SELECT maker, MAX(price)
FROM Product CROSS JOIN PC
GROUP BY maker

Get all maker / PC prices
SELECT Product.maker, PC.model, PC.price
FROM Product
JOIN PC
ON Product.model = PC.model
GROUP BY PC.model
