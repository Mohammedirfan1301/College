mystring object:

capacity 5
size 5
pMon: h e l l o

return a pointer to this object - stucture

p => pointer
h => handle, something we don't know what it is but we will need to pass back

hstr = my_string_init_c_string("hello")
can keep calling this init function and storing the handles

struct my_string contains three members:
int capacity
int size
something that holds a string that is allocated?

status = my_string_concat_c_string("world");
pTemp = reallocate(p , 42);

this is equivant to
pTemp = malloc(42);
if(pTemp != NULL)
{
	memcopy(pTemp, p, *);
	free(p);
}
