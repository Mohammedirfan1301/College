    ==========================================================================     

	Done:
	MYSTRING.C
	MYSTRINGTESTS.C
	DICTIONARY.C
	DICTIONARYTESTS.C
	
	To-do:
	ASSOCARR.C
	ASSOCARRTESTS.C
	HANGMAN.C

	Notes:
	Mystring.c 
	- NO MEMORY LEAKS UDER VALGRIND.
	- Passes all 48 of derrell's tests
	- Passes all 18 of my tests
	
	Dictionary.c
	- NO MEMORY LEAKS UNDER VALGRIND.
	- Passes dictionary.c test
	- Has functions to get which ever sized vector of mystring that you want.
	
	Assocarr.c
	-
	
	Assocarr_test.c
	- 
	
	_Hangman.c 
	- Asks user for basic information about the game
	- Doesn't crash as far as I can tell.
	- Does all required checks, ensuring that nothing that is NULL or invalid is
	  used or passed to other functions. 
	- Ensures user input is valid.
	- Still a work in progress

	KNOWN ISSUES:
	- Assocarr.c not implemented
	- Warnings about "implicit declaration" of two functions in hangman.c. After I
	  added additional declarations of those functions, they went away. Not sure if
	  that is the right thing to do or not. Functions are found in dictionary.c,
	  perhaps that is why - hangman.c can't see them directly?

	DICTIONARY.C NOTES
	In order to get the vector of mystrings to work, I had to put some functions,
	such as mystring assignment and mystring destroyer, into the mystring.c file.
	gcc dictionary_tests.c dictionary.c generic_vector.c mystring.c -o test
	Also, in a related note, to get the vector a vector part to work I had to do
	the same thing, except I put myvector_assignment and myvector_destroyer in
	the generic_vector.c file. 
	
	Made it less straight forward, but it seems to work!
	
	TESTS FILES:
	** Mystring.c Test **
	Used derrell tester
	
	** Dictionary.c Test **
	gcc dictionary_tests.c dictionary.c generic_vector.c mystring.c -o test
	
	** Assocarr.c Test **
	NEED TO IMPLEMENT
	
	** Hangman.c **
	use MAKEFILE.
